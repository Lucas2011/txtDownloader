Candidate Name: Zhang San
Interview Date: June 3, 2025
Interviewer: Li Si
Interview Focus: GCD, Core Data (Technical Round 1)

‚∏ª

üß† Technical Evaluation:

1. GCD (Grand Central Dispatch)
	‚Ä¢	The candidate was presented with a basic design question related to GCD. After an idle/thinking period of around 1‚Äì2 minutes, they produced a near-perfect and well-structured answer.
	‚Ä¢	The response closely resembled content commonly found in public tutorials or AI-generated explanations, lacking personalized insight or project-based examples.
	‚Ä¢	When asked follow-up questions about the reasoning behind the design and debugging experience, the candidate was unable to elaborate meaningfully. This raises concerns about the depth of independent understanding and practical experience.

2. Core Data
	‚Ä¢	The candidate demonstrated familiarity with basic Core Data concepts, such as data models, managed object contexts, and save operations.
	‚Ä¢	When given a real-world multithreading scenario (intentionally containing 3 common mistakes), the candidate was unable to identify any of the issues or suggest debugging strategies.
	‚Ä¢	Their understanding of thread isolation, context synchronization, and safe data access was limited, and they lacked a structured approach to debugging and problem-solving in Core Data environments.

üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Overall Assessment:

The candidate possesses some theoretical knowledge but shows weaknesses in practical, hands-on scenarios. Responses around GCD appeared overly polished and potentially pre-rehearsed, warranting caution around independent problem-solving ability. Core Data debugging skills were insufficient.
