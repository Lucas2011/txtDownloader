Based on the RCA, it seems that Device 2 did not generate logs. Unfortunately, the logs from Device 1 didn’t provide much useful information. After comparing the logs of Device 2 and Device 3 (please see the attached files), I noticed that Device 2 only retained three files post-testing, while Device 3 generated a significantly larger set of files, including the expected matches.

At this point, it doesn’t seem like the issue is directly related to the app. However, since only partial logs are available, I cannot confirm if all devices are using the same build. To ensure consistency, I kindly suggest updating Device 2 to match Device 3’s build and running the test again. This should provide clearer insights for further analysis.
