Subject: Task Allocation During Your Leave

Body:
Hi [Name],

I hope everything is going well with you! To ensure a smooth handover while you’re on leave, I’d like to understand how the tasks you’re currently handling are being allocated or if there are any responsibilities I need to temporarily take over.

Could you please provide the following information:
	1.	What tasks currently need to be allocated?
	2.	Have specific tasks already been assigned to anyone? If so, who are they assigned to?
	3.	Are there any additional details or points to keep in mind?

If you have any documents or background information that you can share, it would be greatly appreciated. I’ll do my best to help manage these tasks during your time off.

Thank you for your help, and I hope you have a wonderful break!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
