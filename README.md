**Subject:** Please Follow Up or Close Previous Tickets

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to ask you to follow up on or close several tickets that you were previously involved with or were the last person to update. These tickets are no longer assigned to your name, but your input is still needed to ensure they are properly resolved or closed.

Here are the tickets that need your attention:

- [Ticket ID 1]: Brief description or status
- [Ticket ID 2]: Brief description or status
- [Ticket ID 3]: Brief description or status
- [Add as necessary]

Please take a moment to review the status of these tickets. If they are already resolved, kindly close them. If further action is required, please chase them down accordingly.

Your prompt attention to this matter will help ensure that all tickets are handled efficiently and nothing falls through the cracks.

Let me know if you need any additional information or support.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]  
[Your Position]
