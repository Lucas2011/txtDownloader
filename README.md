Hi [Colleague’s Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention a few tickets that you’ve worked on previously and are still open. While they are not currently assigned to you, your prior involvement and expertise with these tasks make you uniquely positioned to help move them toward completion.

Here are the tickets I’m referring to:
	•	[Ticket 1]: Brief description
	•	[Ticket 2]: Brief description
	•	[Ticket 3]: Brief description

If you’re able to review and follow up on these tickets, your input would be greatly appreciated. Of course, if you have any questions, need additional context, or run into challenges, please don’t hesitate to reach out—I’m happy to support in any way I can.

Thank you so much for taking the time to assist with this. Your efforts make a big difference to the team.

Best regards,
