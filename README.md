Here’s the revised version with the changes integrated:

Subject: Weekly Progress and Planning Reminder

Dear Team,

I hope you’re all doing well!
Starting this week, I will be reviewing the completed tickets from the previous week and the plans for the upcoming week during my weekly meetings with our manager, and gathering feedback. Please make sure you are completing a reasonable number of tickets each week and are ready to discuss your progress. This will help us stay on track and ensure we address any issues early.

If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out to me for support. Let’s continue to work efficiently and deliver high-quality results.

Thank you for your continued dedication.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

This version integrates the feedback point smoothly into the flow without separating it into a list.
