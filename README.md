Based on your request, I have carefully considered the current situation of our team. Currently, we have a total of six team members, with three individuals focused on developing new features, while the remaining three are dedicated to maintaining our application. Maintaining this balance is crucial to ensuring the smooth progress of our project.

If we were to assign one team member to complete the new task, it would disrupt this balance and could pose risks to our project. I suggest that we first evaluate the current workload and schedule to ensure that we have enough resources to complete the new task without compromising the progress and quality of existing tasks. Could we perhaps consider delaying the start of the new task or exploring alternative solutions to maintain the stability and efficiency of our team? I look forward to hearing your suggestions and thoughts.
