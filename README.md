Dear [Manager's Name],

Thank you for emphasizing the importance of maintaining high standards in our code quality. I understand the critical nature of ensuring that all processes, including unit testing, are followed diligently. Here are the steps I am taking to ensure our team upholds these standards:

1. **Reinforcing Best Practices:** I will remind the team of the importance of following our established coding practices, including the mandatory unit testing for all PRs.

2. **Enhanced Review Process:** I will implement a stricter code review process to ensure that no PR is merged without passing unit tests, regardless of the urgency of the task.

3. **Access to Resources:** I will ensure that all team members have the necessary tools and equipment to perform their tasks, including running unit tests.

4. **Training and Support:** I will arrange for additional training sessions focused on the importance of unit testing and best practices in code quality. I will also be available to support team members who might face challenges in following these practices.

5. **Monitoring and Accountability:** I will set up a system to monitor adherence to these practices and hold the team accountable for any lapses. This will include regular check-ins and retrospective meetings to identify and address any issues promptly.

6. **Documentation and Communication:** I will ensure that all processes are well-documented and clearly communicated via email to the team to avoid any ambiguity.

By taking these steps, I aim to reinforce the importance of our coding standards and ensure that we consistently deliver high-quality code.

Thank you for your guidance and support.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
