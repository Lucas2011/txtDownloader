Hello Manager,

Regarding this ticket, my analysis and actions were based on the following points:
	1.	Crash Cause Analysis
According to the crash IPS report in the ticket, the app crash was primarily caused by insufficient memory. Typically, when the device memory is fully utilized, the operating system prioritizes clearing temporary files and cached data generated by applications (e.g., app cache). This might explain why the user mentioned there was still 34GB available.
	2.	Inconsistencies Between Radar Description and Uploaded Screenshot
The radar description states that there is 34GB available, but the uploaded screenshot shows 479GB remaining. This discrepancy raises some questions about the provided information.
	3.	Missing Critical Logs
The ticket did not include relevant log files, making it difficult to confirm the exact memory usage at the time of the crash. This lack of logs hinders further pinpointing of the issue.

Based on the above, I suggested that the user try a new build and clearly communicated that if the issue persists, they should provide crash-related log files for further analysis.

To avoid similar issues in the future, I will ensure my radar reports include more detailed analyses, potential root causes, and validation suggestions. This will help users better understand the steps needed to resolve the issue.

Thank you for your feedback and suggestions. I will use them to further optimize my workflow.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
