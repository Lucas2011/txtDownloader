**Subject: Request for Log Files to Assist with Issue Investigation**

Hi A,

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m assisting B with an issue he encountered while working on a ticket, and he’s having trouble reproducing the problem. To help resolve this issue, we need some log files and data files for further analysis.

Specifically, we need the following files:

1. **CSV files stored on the device**: These are important for understanding the changes in data, as there is a feature that modifies data after teardown. We need the original data for comparison.

2. **The entire log file after teardown**: If possible, please exclude the iterations files. We need these logs for analysis and to compare with other data.

B plans to use these files as a data source to generate CSV files for further investigation.

Thank you very much for your assistance. If you have any questions or need more information, please let me know.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
