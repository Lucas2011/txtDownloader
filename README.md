iOS Interview Feedback

Candidate Performance Summary:
	1.	Technical Design Skills:
I presented a design question that involved both GCD and Core Data, intended to assess the candidateâ€™s understanding of multithreading and data persistence. The candidate stated that they were unable to complete the task and did not provide a viable design or implementation approach.
	2.	Technical Communication Skills:
During the technical Q&A portion, the candidate struggled to articulate their thoughts clearly and concisely in English. Their responses lacked the use of appropriate terminology and structure needed for effective communication.

Overall Assessment:
The candidate did not demonstrate the level of system design ability or English communication skills expected for this role. I do not recommend moving forward with the interview process.
