Starting tests on all devices simultaneously ensures the following:

1. **Consistency**: Testing under the same conditions and time frame ensures comparability of results, minimizing the impact of environmental variables.

2. **Performance Evaluation**: It provides a more accurate assessment of the system's performance and stability under high load.

3. **Concurrency Issues**: It makes it easier to identify and resolve concurrency issues such as resource contention and deadlocks.

4. **Synchronization Issues**: It helps check if the system's synchronization mechanisms are working correctly, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.

5. **Time Efficiency**: Simultaneous testing reduces overall testing time and improves efficiency.

By starting tests simultaneously, you gain a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior in real-world conditions, ensuring stability and reliability.
