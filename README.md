Subject: Weekly Progress and Planning Reminder

Dear Team,

I hope you’re all doing well!
Starting this week, I will be reviewing the completed tickets from the previous week and the plans for the upcoming week in my weekly meetings with our manager. Please ensure that you are following your task schedules, completing work on time, and keeping everything updated regularly. This will help us maintain smooth progress and address any issues early.

If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out to me for assistance. Let’s continue working efficiently and delivering high-quality results.

Thank you for your continued dedication.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
