1. Update Radars Promptly
    * Prioritize Radar Assignment Based on Urgency: Limit the number of blocker and release radars each team member handles simultaneously. For instance:
        * 2 blocker radars / person
        * 3 release radars/person
        * 4 radars in a mix of blocker and release radars/person
    * Daily Stand-ups and Progress Monitoring: Focus on the progress of blocker and release P1 radars during daily stand-ups, allowing team members to discuss any blockers. Use the Green Pine tool to track radar status in real time and automatically send notifications if radars are not resolved within the specified time.
2. Maintain Code Quality
    * Discuss Hypothetical Fixes: For issues that cannot be reproduced, discuss with the peer reviewer whether the proposed fixes are reasonable before merging. If possible, create an EB first, have QA validate whether these fixes are effective, and then decide whether to merge them into the branch.
    * Improve PR Quality and Pre-Merge Validation: Implement a stricter code review process, especially for blocker radarâ€™s PRs. Besides checking the quality of the code, require peer reviewers to understand the issue in the radar and approve the solution before merging the PR to ensure all issues are resolved.
    * Post-Mortem Analysis: If verification fails in the new build, perform a post-mortem analysis to identify where the problem occurred and how to prevent similar issues in the future.
3. Manage Insufficient Info Radars
    * Handle Insufficient Info Radars: If a P1 radar lacks sufficient information, reassign it to QA, requesting them to provide the necessary details within 1 day. If QA does not respond within the specified time, take the following actions:
        * Request Remote Access: If information is insufficient and the issue is hard to reproduce, try requesting remote access to QA's test environment or device setup.
        * Send Reminder Emails: Email the QA lead to follow up on the progress of the radar.
        * Schedule Meetings: Arrange meetings to discuss and resolve the information gaps directly with the QA team, ensuring timely issue resolution.
    * Issue Analysis: For each radar, provide a root cause analysis to understand and document the underlying issue, which helps prevent similar problems in the future.
