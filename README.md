As a software engineer, I kindly request everyone to review the tickets that have been reassigned, as the DRI will soon be on leave. It would be greatly appreciated if the review could be completed by EOD this Wednesday, ensuring that there are no unresolved dependencies requiring the DRIâ€™s input. Should any dependencies be identified, please reach out to the DRI at your earliest convenience to ensure a smooth workflow.

Here is the list of assigned individuals:
	1.	[Name/Role]
	2.	[Name/Role]
	3.	[Name/Role]
	4.	[Name/Role]

Thank you all for your cooperation and dedication!
