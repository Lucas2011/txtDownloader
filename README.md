Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I want to emphasize the importance of following our established processes, particularly regarding unit testing. Recently, an urgent task was submitted as a PR without undergoing unit testing, which almost caused the system to go down. To prevent similar issues in the future, I am requesting that everyone strictly adhere to the following procedures:

1. **Mandatory Unit Testing:** Before submitting any PR, ensure that your code has passed all relevant unit tests. This step is essential, even for urgent tasks.

2. **PR Submission:** All PRs must be submitted to channel A in the specified format and must have at least one team member as a code reviewer.

3. **Resource Support:** If you lack the necessary tools or equipment to run unit tests, please inform me immediately, and I will provide the required assistance as soon as possible.

4. **Strict Code Review:** During code reviews, I will specifically check the execution of unit tests. Any PR that has not passed unit testing will not be merged.

Unit testing is a crucial step in ensuring the quality of our code and preventing major system issues. Please adhere strictly to these procedures to ensure our workflow proceeds smoothly.

Thank you for your cooperation!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
