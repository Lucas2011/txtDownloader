Subject: Temporary Leave Notification

Dear [Team/All],

I hope this email finds you well. Due to the needs of my newborn, I may occasionally need to take short leaves in the upcoming weeks.

To ensure work continuity, I have handed over my tasks to [Colleague A]. If you have any questions or need further assistance during my absence, please feel free to reach out to [Colleague A] or our manager, [Manager B].

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please let me know if there’s anything I can assist with before my leave.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

如果需要改动，可以告诉我！
