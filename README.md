Hereâ€™s a more polished and professional summary:

Issue 1: Network interruption during ticket creation

Proposed Solution:
Implement a retry mechanism to handle network interruptions gracefully. If retries ultimately fail, provide clear feedback to the user, ensuring they are aware of the issue and can take appropriate action.

Issue 2: Attachment upload incomplete or missing after ticket creation

Proposed Solution:
Adopt a similar retry strategy to reattempt incomplete or missing uploads. Additionally, notify the user if the retry fails, enabling them to address the issue directly.

Issue 3: Upload progress label not updating

Proposed Solution:
Monitor the progress actively and introduce a retry mechanism if the progress label fails to update. This will ensure the user receives accurate feedback about the upload status.
